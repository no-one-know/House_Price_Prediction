# House Price Prediction
<p>I have used the famous <b><a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/">Boston</a></b> housing data for creating a predictive model that predicts the hosue of the price in the boston town</p>
<p>I have performed <b>EDA</b> on the various factors that were contributing to the price of the house in the boston area.</p>
<p>Factors affecting the price in the area are:-</p>
<ul>
    <li>per capita crime rate by town</li>
    <li>proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.</li>
    <li>proportion of non-retail business acres per town</li>
    <li>Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)</li>
    <li>nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)</li>
    <li>average number of rooms per dwelling</li>
    <li>proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940</li>
    <li>weighted distances to five Boston employment centres</li>
    <li>index of accessibility to radial highways</li>
    <li>full-value property-tax rate per $10,000</li>
    <li>pupil-teacher ratio by town</li>
    <li>1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of black people by town</li>
    <li>% lower status of the population</li>
</ul>
<p><b>AdaboostRegressor</b> model gave the accuracy of 89% and was used in the web application.</p>
